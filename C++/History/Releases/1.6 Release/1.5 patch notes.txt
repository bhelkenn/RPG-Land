The following changes and bug fixes have been made to the program:

1.	Fixed a bug where attempting to cancel casting a spell (out of combat) got registered as an invalid entry.
2.	Added "Requires Level" text when displaying shop inventory (blacksmith and inn), as well as player inventory.
3.	Fixed a bug where you can crash the program by choosing an invalid entry when viewing detailed info about an item in inventory.
4.	Added detailed prompts whenever an incorrect input is detected for the menu.
5.	Fixed a bug where creating a new character when one already exists causes a freeze when attempting to leave town.
6.	Combined casting functions with a bool variable to dictate in-combat vs. out-of-combat behavior (reduces code complexity and increases stability).
7.	Added a description for every item, displayed when viewing an item in detail.
8.	Decreased escape chance from creatures to 75% +/- 10% based on creature stance; boss encounters' escape chance decreased to 30% +/- 10%;
